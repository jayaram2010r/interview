1. What is a Pod in Kubernetes?

 A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster and can contain one or more containers.
yaml
CopyEdit
# pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: nginx
 image: nginx
 ports:
 - containerPort: 80

2. What is a Deployment in Kubernetes? Write a deployment.yaml for deploying 3 replicas of an Nginx container.

 A Deployment is a controller that ensures the desired number of pod replicas are running. It allows rolling updates and rollbacks.
yaml
CopyEdit
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
 name: nginx-deployment
spec:
 replicas: 3
 selector:
 matchLabels:
 app: nginx
 template:
 metadata:
 labels:
 app: nginx
 spec:
 containers:
 - name: nginx
 image: nginx
 ports:
 - containerPort: 80

3. What is a Service in Kubernetes, and what are the types?

 A Service exposes a set of pods as a network service.
 Types:
ClusterIP (default) – internal access within the cluster
NodePort – exposes service on each Node’s IP at a static port
LoadBalancer – exposes service via a cloud provider’s load balancer
ExternalName – maps service to an external DNS name

4. When would you use each type of Kubernetes Service (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName)?

ClusterIP – internal communication (e.g., between microservices)
NodePort – expose service for testing/dev on a static port
LoadBalancer – expose to the internet in cloud environments
ExternalName – route to external services like database.example.com

5. Explain port, targetPort, and nodePort in a Service.

port: Port exposed by the Service (used inside the cluster)
targetPort: Port on the Pod the traffic is forwarded to
nodePort: (for NodePort type) External port on the node

6. How would you expose a Kubernetes app externally?

Use a LoadBalancer service (cloud)
Use NodePort (local/testing)
Use Ingress with an Ingress Controller

7. What is Helm, and what are its components (Chart, Repository, Release)?

Chart: A packaged Kubernetes application (YAML + templates)
Repository: Stores charts
Release: A deployed instance of a chart in a cluster

8. What is the difference between EXPOSE in a Dockerfile and docker run -p?

EXPOSE (Dockerfile): declares the container listens on a port (docs only)
-p (docker run): actually maps a container port to a host port

9. How do you run Nginx on a Linux server using Docker?
bash
CopyEdit
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginx nginx
